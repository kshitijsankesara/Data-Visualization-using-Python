# Data-Visualization-on-Python

To help clients understand Data Visualization using Python, I created multiple data visualization notebooks. The notebooks covered basic graphs and plots to more advanced visualization techniques using **Bokeh, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.** I have made use of World Indicators and Gapminder data sets that are available on the Internet. I started by performing some data cleaning and pre-processing and later moved to explore data using different visualization techniques.


The different plots that I created were:
1. Line Plots
2. Scatter Plots
3. The different types of Bar Plots
4. Pie Chart
5. Heat Map for Correlations
6. Violin Plot
7. Histograms
8. Density Plots
9. Pair plots
10. Interactive graphs for using Bokeh


The Jupyter Notebooks cover the different visualization techniques in detail.
